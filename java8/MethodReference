:: -> Method reference & Constructor reference.


interface interf{
  public void m1();
}

class Test{
   public static void m2(){
     System.out.println("method reference");
   }

   public static void main(String args[]){
     interf i = Test::m2
     i.m1();
   }

}


-> whenever m1 implemention is required, we can give m2 reference.
-> internally it will call the m1()
-> its used for code re-usability
-> both method should have same argument type.
