A class that is declared using “abstract” keyword is known as abstract class. 
It may or may not include abstract methods which means in abstract class you can have concrete methods (methods with body) 
as well along with abstract methods ( without an implementation, without braces, and followed by a semicolon). 
An abstract class can not be instantiated (you are not allowed to create object of Abstract class).


// Declaration using abstract keyword
abstract class AbstractDemo{
   // Concrete method: body and braces
   public void myMethod(){
      //Statements here
   }

   // Abstract method: without body and braces 
   abstract public void anotherMethod();
}


Since abstract class allows concrete methods as well, it does not provide 100% abstraction 
You can say that it provides partial abstraction. Interfaces are used for 100% abstraction

Remember two rules:
1) If the class is having few abstract methods and few concrete methods: declare it as abstract class.
2) If the class is having only abstract methods: declare it as interface.

The class that extends the abstract class, have to implement all the abstract methods of abstract class, else they can be declared abstract in the class as well.

An abstract class has no use until unless it is extended by some other class.
If you declare an abstract method (discussed below) in a class then you must declare the class abstract as well. you can’t have abstract method in a non-abstract class. 
If a class is not having any abstract method then also it can be marked as abstract.
Abstract class can have non-abstract method (concrete) as well.
