RunnableDemo vs Callable:
=========================

RunnableDemo tasks can be run using the Thread class or ExecutorService whereas Callables can be run
only using the latter.

The RunnableDemo interface is a functional interface and has a single run() method which doesn't accept
any parameters and does not return any values.

The Callable interface is a generic interface containing a single call() method â€“ which returns a generic value V.


ExecutorService:
===================

ExecutorService is a JDK API that simplifies running tasks in asynchronous mode.

Thread vs RunnableDemo:
=====================

there are two ways to create threads. One using RunnableDemo interface and another by extending Thread class.
