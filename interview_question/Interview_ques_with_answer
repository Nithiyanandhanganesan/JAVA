1. What is JIT compiler in java?
  - java source code --> JDK --> byte code --> JRE(Intepreter + JIT compiler) --> Machine codes
  - here intepreter job is to convert byte code. It take more time to convert.
  - So, JIT is introduced for optimization.

2. What is marker Interface?
  - Interface having no data member and member functions.
  - Empty interface is called as Marker interface.
  - Eg: Serializable , Cloneable.
     public interface TestInterface {
     }
  - Then why this empty inteface is needed?
     - its just tells compiler on metadata.

3. Can you override private or static method in JAVA?
  - You cannot override a private or static method.
  - You cannot override a private method in sub class becaz its not accessible.
    But you can create another private method with the same name in child class.
  - For static method, if you create a similar method with same return type and same method argument
    in the child class, then it will hide the superclass method, this is known as method hiding.


4. What method does Object class have?
  - Object class is parent of all classes in JAVA
  - protected Object clone() -> create and returns a copy of this object.
  - public boolean equals(Object obj) -> indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
  - protected void finalize() -> called by garbage collector when garbagecollection determines that
    there are no more references to this object.
  - public final Class getClass() - return runtime class of an object.
  - public int hashCode() - return hash code value of an object.
  - public String toString()
  - public final void notify()
  - public final void notifyAll()
  - public final void wait()

5. How can you make class Immutable?
  - Declare the class as final, so it cant be extended.
  - Make all fields as private, so that direct access is not allowed.
  - Dont provide setter method for variables.
  - Make all mutable fields final, so that its value can be assigned only once.
  - Initialize all the fields via a constructor performing a deep copy.
  - Perform cloning of objects in the getter method to return copy rather than returning the actual
    object reference.

6. What is singleton class in java and how can we make class singleton?
  - Only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM.
  - Create constructor as private .
  - Eg:
   public class SingletonExample {

       //crete static instance
       private static SingletonExample single_instance = null;

       //create private constructor.
       private SingletonExample(){
       }

       //this block will make sure only one instance is created.
       public static SingletonExample getInstance() {
           if(single_instance == null)
               single_instance = new SingletonExample();

           return single_instance
       }
   }
